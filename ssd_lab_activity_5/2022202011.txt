Private variables-

Private variables are used when we don't want to provide access to the attributes of the object to the 
outside world. It should be only accessed by that particular object.
In the below example Pin is private as it should only be accessed by objects to which PIN belong and not
by another object.


Public variables-

Public variables are used when we don't want to hide them from other objects and can access directly 
without using class methods.
In the below example Bankname is public,so no need to hide it from other objects.


Static variables-

Static variables are those which belong to the class, not to the object.Only one copied is created and shared by all
other objects.
In the below example countCustomers is a static variable that gives information about the number of 
account holders banks have currently.


Privilege variables-

Privilege variables are those which can be accessed by some other object but not by all.
In the case of a Bank, the Joint Account holders can also withdraw money as they have access to the account
which other account holder also holds.


Example code to show working of above variables--------

class AccountHolder{
 
#pin=1234;// private variable
#bankbalance=1000;
bankName="State Bank of India"; // public variable
static countCustomers=0; // static variable


constructor(){
AccountHolder.countCustomers++;
}
setPin(){
this.#pin=4321;
}

get Pin(){
return this.#pin;
} 
}

const holder1=new AccountHolder();

holder1.setPin();
console.log(holder1.Pin);
console.log(holder1.bankName);

const holder2=new AccountHolder();
const holder3=new AccountHolder();

console.log(AccountHolder.countCustomers);// total number of customers
