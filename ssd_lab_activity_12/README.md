# SSD - Lab Activity 12

# Pressure Sensing Mat

## Instructions for the question

- The folder contains two files main.py and input.txt.
- Both question1 and question2 is implemented in the main.py file only.

- For running question1
  ```python3 main.py q1```
- For running question2
  ```python3 main.py q2```
- The input file had uneven line breaks between the two matrices. This leads to problems while reading the matrices. So, I have added only one line break between two consecutive matrices to maintain similarity.

- The median value of time for the corresponding matrices has been taken as timestamp for them.
